        <h2>Our volunteer community</h2>
        <p>
          The power of MDN lies in its vast, vital community of active users and
          contributors. Since 2005, approximately 45,000 contributors have
          created the documentation we know and love. Together, contributors
          have created over 45,000 documents that make up an up-to-date,
          comprehensive, and free resource for web developers around the world.
          In addition to English-language articles, over 35 volunteers lead
          translation and localization efforts for Chinese, French, Japanese,
          Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. With over 200 commits per
          week, the culture of active contribution is going strong. And you can
          be a part of it.

        <h2>Our partners</h2>
        <h3>The Product Advisory Board</h3>
        <p>
          MDN collaborates with partners from across the industry, including
          standards bodies, browser vendors, and other industry leaders. Since
          2017, these collaborators are formally represented through the Product
          Advisory Board (PAB). MDN is an influential resource and the PAB helps
          ensure that MDN’s influence puts the web first, not any one vendor or
          organization, and respects the needs of web developers across the
          industry. Each quarter, the PAB meets to discuss problems, prioritize
          content creation, and make connections for future collaborations.

          <span class="material-symbols-outlined"> format_quote </span> MDN has
          a unique place right now as a vendor-neutral and authoritative
          documentation and information resource for web developers. The MDN PAB
          has helped to bring feedback from the wider web community (including
          standards engineers, web browser makers and open source developers)
          into MDN to help keep it strong. As a member of the web community and
          a fan of MDN it’s been great to be a part of.
